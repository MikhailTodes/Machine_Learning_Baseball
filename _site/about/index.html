<p>I am currently enrolled in a Master of Science in Robotics program at Northwestern University. The courses I have taken or am currently taking include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Embedded Systems</li>
  <li>Robotic Manipulation</li>
  <li>Machine Dynamics</li>
  <li>Computational Geometry</li>
  <li>Digital Image Analysis</li>
  <li>Feedback Systems</li>
  <li>Mechatronics</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="education-and-training">Education and Training</h2>

<p>In January 2011, directly after matriculating from high school, I started studying at the University of Cape Town. I enrolled to do a BSc (Eng) in Mechatronics Engineering and I graduated in December 2014. During my studies, I attended a practical training course at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. There I learnt a few practical engineering trades including: to arc weld; to use a lathe machine; design automation with pneumatics; applied metrology; CNC machining; heat tempering and hardening; and Computer Aided Drafting.</p>

<p>In November 2013, I did a two month internship in the Bioelectronics and Neuroscience (BENS) Research Program at the University of Western Sydney. The projects that I was involved in were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design and construction of a robotic system for stimulation and feedback control of the human peripheral sensory system (tactile sensing)</li>
  <li>Design and construction of hardware for a ping-pong playing robot</li>
</ul>

<p>While I was there I also attended a seminar on the use of an Arduino for network communications.</p>

<p>Experience with Windows and Linux operating systems as well as ROS (Robot Operating System).</p>

<h2 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h2>

<ul>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>MATLAB</li>
  <li>Mathematica</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-interests-and-skills">Other Interests and Skills</h2>

<p>Other than Engineering I like to spend my time outdoors. When I get the chance I enjoy surfing, hiking, mountain biking, and a new found fondness of snow boarding. I have a skippers license as well a scuba diving license. Other sports I enjoy to play and watch include: Football, Cricket, Rugby, and Cycling. I have participated and completed the Cape Town Cycle Race on seven occasions as well as numerous other races. I have also summited Mount Kilimanjaro.</p>

<h2 id="languages">Languages</h2>

<ul>
  <li>English (Native language)</li>
  <li>Afrikaans</li>
  <li>Hebrew</li>
</ul>
